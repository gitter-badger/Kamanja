- Before running the DataGenerationTool please take a look at "./JsonFiles/DataGenerationConfig.json" as an example of Configuration file.

- Create your own Configuration file, or edit the pathes inside the already available one.

- Also, edit the pathes inside "./DataGenerationTool/resources/log4j.properties" to reflect the directory you want to save the log files to.

- When attempting to run , add the path of "DataGenerationConfig.json" as an argument.
