**Notes**

This project has _**testing resources only**_.  The source files have been merged with the JpmmlFactoryOfModelInstanceFactory.
The JpmmlFactoryOfModelInstanceFactory has the implementations for the ModelInstance, ModelInstanceFactory, and
FactoryOfModelInstanceFactory in its source files.  

This is done to facilitate the ingestion of so-called adapter-like projects where a given base model (e.g., the _**JpmmlAdapter**_)
can support all of its type (i.e., _**JPMML**_ models).
